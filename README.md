# Learning about Version Control

“Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!”

What I like most about version control is the ability to track all changes in a single repository. If something breaks, we can easily revert to a previous commit in a clean and organized manner. This not only protects our work but also allows us to take credit for our contributions without creating cluttered duplicate files.

What frustrates me the most about version control is dealing with merge conflicts. When multiple people edit the same complex files, such as notebooks, resolving conflicts can be challenging and time-consuming. To minimize conflicts and reduce the need for lengthy conflict resolution sessions, we can use branches in Git. This allows each contributor to work independently on their part without worrying about interfering with others' work. Conflicts would then only need to be resolved at the end when the branches are merged.
